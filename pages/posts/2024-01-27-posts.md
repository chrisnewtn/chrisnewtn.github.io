# Posts!

So, I figure I'm going to start posting to this website. Why not.

My current ideas centre around how JavaScript has changed over the years. Ideas like:

* Asynchronicity. Callbacks to Promises to Async/Await.
* Modularity. CommonJS and Browserify, AMD and Require.js, Modules today.
* Components. MVC and Backbone.js, React, Web Components. The web components part is going to take a bit of reading as I have never used them in anger and still don't know a lot about them.
* Iteration. Regular loops, Underscore.js, functional methods, Node streams and generators.

The theme here is how patterns and techniques enter the JS ecosystem as libraries or compile-to-JS languages and, over time, are gradually standardized into the Web platform or the JavaScript language itself.

There'll be time for other content too. I'm sure I'll post about making this website, as well as other projects. Maybe I'll even post about film and games and stuff, who knows!

Of course there's a strong possibility this ends up the only post on the site. Wouldn't that be classic.
